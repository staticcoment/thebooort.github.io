# The Open Bacteria Project 

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebooort/thebooort.github.io/master/assets/images/bacteria_banner.png)

This project was created to participate in the national interdisciplinary universitary competition [IMPACIENCIA](http://impaciencia.org).
The final was celebrated in MÃ¡laga the 28th of April (2018)... AND WE WON!

Keep reading to know a little more about the project we want to develop (this didn't end with the competition!).


 We are a group of students that are trying to create a global repository about bacteria, but with different science perspectives in order not only to fully understand their nature but also to allow everyone to have a full suite about what tool can help us to do so.

On the mathematical side, we have develop diferent functions that can emulate and predict bacteria growth and some properties.

On the biological one we have develop full documentation about how to replicate bacteria experiments, information to understand them and biliography to go deeper in the subject.

Furthermore we have develop some functions that allow us to recognise different bacteria colonies from photos that will allow us (and every people) to create live simulations from photos in the future.

Finally we have develop a web app that allow every one to take a brief look in our work and try their own experiments.

In the future we expect to develop this web app and transform it in the first social network to share bacteria experiments around the world between scientist, students, teaches and everyday people. This may be a powerfull tool that may lead to facilitate the biologists work in microbiology (even discover some home-experiments about antibiotics that could discover new ones)

Does it sound exiciting to you? Well, great news: You can follow our science adventures:
